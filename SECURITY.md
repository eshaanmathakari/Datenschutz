# Security Policy

## Overview

Datenschutz is a security-focused application that helps organizations identify and remediate vulnerabilities in their codebase. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and compliance mappings.

## üîí Security Features

### Automated Security Scanning

Our application includes comprehensive security scanning capabilities:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Automated code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime security checks and monitoring
- **Dependency Scanning**: Identification of vulnerable dependencies
- **Container Security**: Docker image vulnerability scanning

### Vulnerability Detection Standards

We map all detected vulnerabilities to established security standards:

#### OWASP Top 10 (2021 Edition)
- **A01:2021 - Broken Access Control**: Path traversal, privilege escalation
- **A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures**: Weak encryption, hardcoded secrets
- **A03:2021 - Injection**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection
- **A04:2021 - Insecure Design**: Security design flaws
- **A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration**: Default configs, verbose errors
- **A06:2021 - Vulnerable Components**: Outdated dependencies
- **A07:2021 - Authentication Failures**: Weak passwords, session management
- **A08:2021 - Data Integrity Failures**: Insecure deserialization
- **A09:2021 - Logging Failures**: Insufficient security logging
- **A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery**: SSRF vulnerabilities

#### CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Mappings

| Vulnerability Type | CWE ID | Severity | OWASP Category |
|-------------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| SQL Injection | CWE-89 | High | A03:2021 - Injection |

| Command Injection | CWE-78 | Critical | A03:2021 - Injection |
| Path Traversal | CWE-22 | High | A01:2021 - Broken Access Control |
| Hardcoded Credentials | CWE-798 | Critical | A07:2021 - Authentication Failures |
| Weak Cryptography | CWE-327 | High | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures |
| Insecure Random | CWE-338 | Medium | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures |
| XML External Entity | CWE-611 | High | A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration |
| Buffer Overflow | CWE-120 | Critical | A06:2021 - Vulnerable Components |
| Insecure Deserialization | CWE-502 | Critical | A08:2021 - Data Integrity Failures |
| Insufficient Logging | CWE-778 | Low | A09:2021 - Logging Failures |
| Server-Side Request Forgery | CWE-918 | High | A10:2021 - SSRF |

## üè¢ Compliance Framework Support

### PCI DSS 4.0
Our security scanning helps meet the following requirements:
- **Requirement 6.2.4**: Custom application security testing
- **Requirement 6.3.2**: Code review processes for custom applications
- **Requirement 11.3.1**: Application penetration testing
- **Requirement 11.3.2**: Network penetration testing

### ISO 27001:2022
Supports compliance with these controls:
- **A.8.24**: Information systems security testing during development
- **A.8.25**: Application security testing in production
- **A.8.29**: Security testing integration in development lifecycle

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0
Aligns with these functions:
- **Identify (ID.RA)**: Risk Assessment processes
- **Protect (PR.DS)**: Data Security measures
- **Detect (DE.CM)**: Continuous Monitoring capabilities
- **Respond (RS.AN)**: Analysis and Investigation tools

### HIPAA Security Rule
Helps maintain compliance with:
- **164.308**: Administrative Safeguards for access controls
- **164.310**: Physical Safeguards for system security
- **164.312**: Technical Safeguards for data protection

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to: [security@yourorganization.com](mailto:security@yourorganization.com)
3. Include the following information:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested remediation steps

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Update**: Weekly until resolution
- **Resolution**: Target of 30 days for critical issues, 90 days for others

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow **responsible disclosure** practices
- Security fixes will be released as soon as possible
- Credit will be given to reporters in release notes (unless anonymity is requested)
- CVE numbers will be assigned for qualifying vulnerabilities

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow deployment security guidelines
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS and secure network configurations
5. **Monitoring**: Enable security logging and monitoring

### For Contributors

1. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP secure coding practices
2. **Code Review**: All security-related changes require review
